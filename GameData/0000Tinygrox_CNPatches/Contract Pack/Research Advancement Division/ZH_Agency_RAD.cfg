    @description = 研究推进部门是一家由那些富有的所谓"慈善家"的坎巴拉人资助的公司。他们对于科学突破进展取决于我们操控火箭爆炸方向感到十分不满，于是决定亲自下场解决问题，他们给我们提供了资金。如果我们在他们指定的地方以特定的方式进行定向爆破，他们就会发钱。我们对此并无怨言，我们需要这笔钱。 // Research Advancement Division is a company funded by some well-off so-called 'philantropic' Kerbals who became impatient with scientific progress being dependent on whichever random direction our rockets are exploding towards. They decided to take matters into their own hands by providing us with funds if we crash things in places they tell us to. And preferably in a specific way too. We're not complaining, we can use the cash.
