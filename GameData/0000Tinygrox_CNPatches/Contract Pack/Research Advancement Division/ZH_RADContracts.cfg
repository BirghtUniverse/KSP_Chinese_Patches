    @genericTitle = 进行大气调查 // Perform an atmospheric investigation
    @genericDescription = 进行一次大气调查 // Perform an atmospheric investigation
	@title = 在 @targetBody 的多处区域调查大气 // Investigate the atmosphere in several areas on @targetBody
	@description = With all this focus on space stuff all around this place you'd almost forget that there's interesting things that are not in space, too! One of the eggheads told us (implored, even) that studying atmospheric phenomena is at least as valuable for our... science program. Or was he talking about the lab's airconditioning.. That might explain why he turned just a little greener than usual. Just be sure, get out there and get some atmospheric data from the skies of @targetBody for us, will you?
    @synopsis = <color=yellow>Investigate the atmosphere on @targetBody, perform the required experiments. Take note which areas are requested!</color>
    @completedMessage = Yeah sorry, it was definitely the airconditioning. We'll file your report somewhere safe, who knows someone may actually look at it within a few years. Or a hundred.

{
    @genericTitle = Perform an orbital biome observation
    @genericDescription = Perform an orbital biome observation
    @title = Observe @biome1 and @biome2 from space
    @description = We've taken an interest in certain areas on @targetBody. Purely scientifically, of course. We'd like you to investigate @biome1 and @biome2. Don't get too close however, that would be suspici-... harmful for the data we require. So best you do this from orbit. Yes do stay up there, far away, that'll be quite enough. Off you go, shoo.
    @synopsis = <color=yellow>Send a craft into space around @targetBody, taking extra care to make sure your orbit crosses the required areas and perform the required experiments.</color>
    @completedMessage = Good, good, that's some excellent intel *ahem* scientific data you've gathered. We'll take it from here!

{
    @genericTitle = Gather remaining data
    @genericDescription = Gather remaining data
    @title = Gather leftover data for experiments on @targetBody
    @description = It came to our attention that there's some experiments that you've done, for which the data we received is yet incomplete. This of course cannot stand, how are we to explain this to our superiors?! Go and remedy the situation with all due haste. Do be diligent, I'm sure there's still a vacancy in the testing department for you otherwise. I'm sure you understand.
    @synopsis = <color=yellow>Gather the remaining data for experiments on @targetBody. Pay attention to the necessary recovery method!</color>
    @completedMessage = Finally some satisfactory data. You may continue... for now.

{
    @genericTitle = Execute a local observation flight
    @genericDescription = Execute a local observation flight
    @title = Execute a local observation flight at @biome1
    @description = I'm sure you're aware of the existence of @biome1. We certainly are. What you may not be aware of, is that we think @biome1 is a strange place. More specifically, according to our highly sophisticated **REDACTED** this area has a high potential for **REDACTED**. The only way to be sure however, is for you to send some hardware over there and confirm. 
    @synopsis = <color=yellow>Send a craft to the sky above @biome1 and perform the required experiments.</color>
    @completedMessage = What wonderful news! These discoveries will surely forever change the **REDACTED** of our great **REDACTED**!

{
    @genericTitle = Perform an orbital study
    @genericDescription = Perform an orbital study
    @title = Perform an orbital study from orbit of @targetBody.
    @description = We know that @targetBody is a place of mystery, of intrigue. But mostly, it's a place we, and by we we mean you, have not done enough science yet. Get out to space around it and don't come back until you've done all the requested experiments!
    @synopsis = <color=yellow>Send a craft into space around @targetBody and perform the requested experiments. Be mindful of the altitudes required.</color>
    @completedMessage = That'll do, for now anyway. You may leave the results on the desk.

{
    @genericTitle = Gather data from the surface
    @genericDescription = Gather data from the surface
    @title = Gather data from the surface at @biome1
    @description = We've obtained some good imagery of the surface of @targetBody. Normally this would be none of your concern, but there's something odd with these pictures. Our top labcoats are confused, even the janitor was clueless. There's this smear you see. Or is it a smudge? A speck? Or a blur..? Well nevermind, whatever it is, it's located at @biome1. We want you to go there and get some properly close up and personal info on the area. Get to the surface over there and report back what you find. 
    @synopsis = <color=yellow>Send a craft onto the surface of @targetBody and perform the required experiments.</color>
    @completedMessage = That's odd, the data you've gathered shows nothing out of the ordinary. How perfectly unsatisfying. We're still going to fire that janitor.

@CONTRACT_TYPE[RAD_SurfaceMulti]:NEEDS[ContractPacks/RAD]:FOR[CNPatches]
{
    @genericTitle = Analyze the surface
    @genericDescription = Analyze the surface at different locations
    @title = Analyze the surface at @biome1 and @biome2
    @description = One of our resident scientists has had an epiphany. They're saying our experimental data would be improved if we performed the same experiments in multiple locations. Something about causality, correlation, significancy and all that. Don't worry we're not sure either. The point is, our scientist's enthusiasm has brought in more budget from our sponsors. Under condition that we actually do those experiments of course. We can't be bothered with such menial work, naturally. Go and analyze @biome1 and @biome2 from the surface for us.
    @synopsis = <color=yellow>Send a craft onto the surface of @targetBody at @biome1 and @biome2 and perform the required experiments.</color>
    @completedMessage = Well, well. It looks like our dear scientist wasn't all up in the cuckoo's nest after all. Don't go telling them this though, next they'll want a promotion, a raise, or some other unwanted complication.
