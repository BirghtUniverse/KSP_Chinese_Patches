    @genericTitle = 进行大气调查 // Perform an atmospheric investigation
    @genericDescription = 进行一次大气调查 // Perform an atmospheric investigation
	@title = 在 @targetBody 的多处区域调查大气 // Investigate the atmosphere in several areas on @targetBody
	@description = With all this focus on space stuff all around this place you'd almost forget that there's interesting things that are not in space, too! One of the eggheads told us (implored, even) that studying atmospheric phenomena is at least as valuable for our... science program. Or was he talking about the lab's airconditioning.. That might explain why he turned just a little greener than usual. Just be sure, get out there and get some atmospheric data from the skies of @targetBody for us, will you?
    @synopsis = <color=yellow>Investigate the atmosphere on @targetBody, perform the required experiments. Take note which areas are requested!</color>
    @completedMessage = Yeah sorry, it was definitely the airconditioning. We'll file your report somewhere safe, who knows someone may actually look at it within a few years. Or a hundred.
